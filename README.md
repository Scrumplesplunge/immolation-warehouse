Immolation Warehouse
====================

**You are on fire**.  Earn as many points as possible **by making other things catch fire too**.

Some things (_like windows, doors and tables_) smash when you bash into them a few times, or leave them to burn.  Other things (_like barrels of TNT_) **explode magnificently if they get too damaged**.  Try ~~not to burn to death~~ to **suspend your death** by **completing the level** (reach the 'red' square before the bar at the bottom gets to the right hand side) or by **collecting water bottles**, which cool you down and delay your inevitable demise!
